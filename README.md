# Chinese-Translate-gb2312-big5
Translate Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese via Powershell. If we get a tar file compressed with GB2322 and our PC is big5, we will get an error decode file name. The script will search the current folder and decode it to the correct filename form in GB2322 and big5.
